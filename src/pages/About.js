                  I know it's confusing out there, I have been there myself.
                  Finding the right kind of support can be downright
                  frustrating. The good news is, you have landed in the right
                  place.
                  <br />
                  While food may be the most important tool in transforming your
                  health, your relationship with your health is complex,
                  multi-layered, and intricate. I am here to gently hold your
                  hand while you rewrite your personal recipe to thriving in
                  your body, mind and soul.
                  <br />
                  <b>Because food? Is never just about the food. </b>
                  <br />
                  I consider our relationship with the food we eat and how we
                  treat our bodies as the most important and primal relationship
                  we have, yet it can often be the most complicated. While we
                  hear many do's and don'ts each and everyday through our media
                  and our communities, most of us are left confused. <br />
                  <b>
                    Don't worry. I can help you navigate all of this and learn
                    what is just right for you to make a lasting and sustainable
                    difference in how you feel each and every day.

                  <br />
                  <i>
                    Let me remind you that your health is not only about what
                    you eat, but also about how you eat, how you relate to your
                    body, and how you connect with yourself â€“ body-mind-soul.
                  </i>

                  In my practice, I use a combination of science-based testing,
                  clinical nutrition, holistic nutrition, natural medicine,
                  functional medicine, homeopathy, herbal medicine, metabolic
                  typing, personalized coaching, and my signature methodology so
                  that you can experience clarity, peace, vitality, self-love
                  and body-positive living.
                  <br />
                  You too can enjoy the art of eating to love your body with
                  every bite and the power to revolutionize your relationship to
                  your food, pleasure, and self-care.
                  <br />

                  you are in your journey, you are going to be relieved reclaim
                  your health through total food and body freedom finally!

                <h3>What is Functional Nutrition?</h3>
                <p>
                  Just as Functional Medicine approaches the body from the
                  perspective of treating the root cause of disease, Functional
                  Nutrition looks at the foundational way that food affects your
                  body at the cellular level. By using food as your most
                  powerful tool in transforming your health, you can positively
                  influence your biochemistry, prevent and treat imbalances,
                  change the way you think and relate to food and have a
                  sustainable and lasting impact on how you feel.
